2) hierarchy of classes wrapping arguments of validators
3) Each validator has 2 constructors: one with its parameters object one as simple as possible.

BC bug - line PKIXCertPathReviewer:2417 (1.46 version) 
NPE possible if DistributionPoint extension
has no DistributionPointName defined, what is perfectly fine according to the spec.

        if (crlDistPoints != null)
        {
            DistributionPoint[] distPoints = crlDistPoints.getDistributionPoints();
            for (int i = 0; i < distPoints.length; i++)
            {
                DistributionPointName dp_name = distPoints[i].getDistributionPoint();

BC - many problems with CRLs e.g. when SelfIssued certificates are in chain in PKIXCerPathReviewer.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer bug - NC checking is always ignoring the last (EE) certificate.
Should do this only when it is self-signed and not last.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer bug - NC checking is ignoring mail component checks.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer - should share logic with JCA cert path validator. Many things
missing or wrong.

BC - CertPathValidatorUtilities.getDeltaCRLs - throw is missing in the first catch.
