Impl:
-) fix the remaining NIST problems
---) test 4.21
---) test 5.4
---) test 5.5
 
-) testcase for IF_VALID CRL checking (no CRL).
-) cleanup the mess imported from BC as much as possible. Should be possible to remove 
all classes from the bc package when it is fixed. 
-) refactor interfaces to make them easily extendible
-) Debug the problem with the signature validation of the test 4.13.19 NIST
-) OCSP support


Testing:
-) implement NIST testsuite

Other:
-) Documentation: create asciidoc docs, including Functional Description, 
Software Design Description, Build Documentation and Error Code Documentation 
-) document how validation is performed
-) extend documentation with best practices, warnings and known issues.
-) Push to maven central
-) Etics


BC bug - line PKIXCertPathReviewer:2417 (1.46 version) 
NPE possible if DistributionPoint extension
has no DistributionPointName defined, what is perfectly fine according to the spec.

        if (crlDistPoints != null)
        {
            DistributionPoint[] distPoints = crlDistPoints.getDistributionPoints();
            for (int i = 0; i < distPoints.length; i++)
            {
                DistributionPointName dp_name = distPoints[i].getDistributionPoint();

BC - many problems with CRLs e.g. when SelfIssued certificates are in chain in PKIXCerPathReviewer.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer bug - NC checking is always ignoring the last (EE) certificate.
Should do this only when it is self-signed and not last.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer bug - NC checking is ignoring mail component checks.

BC - PKIXCertPathReviewer - should share logic with JCA cert path validator. Many things
missing or wrong.

BC - CertPathValidatorUtilities.getDeltaCRLs - throw is missing in the first catch.
