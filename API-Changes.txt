1) changed semantics of the DN compare methods operating on the string representation.
2) changed ParseException to (runtime) IllegalArgumentException in X500NameUtils. 
3) changed slightly X500NameUtils.getAttributeValues description 
(string form is returned whenever it is possible). also do not return null.
4) removed 3 duplicated methods from CertificateUtils (are in ProxyUtils).
5) CertificateUtils.savePEMKeystore accepts also a separate KS's key's password.
6) CertificateUtils.savePrivateKey allows to write also encrypted DER keys.
7) CertificateUtils.loadPEMKeystore accepts also a separate KS's key's password.
8) Added to more constants to FormatMode for one line printing. 
9) For completeness getKeyAlias method was added to the X509Credential interface.
10) Removed possibility to get not handled non-critical extensions. 
11) Methods setCrl in validators now accepts Set<String> not Set<URL> 
as wildcards may be used.
12) Constructors of validators use a single CRLParams argument as CRL configuration
became more complex
13) added dispose method to validators
14) added new listener to validators: get notification when update error occur
15) added new validator type: FlexibleCertChainValidator
16) optional possibility to add updateError observers in constructor of validators 
17) minor change in ret value of the ProxyChainInfo getXXYYRestriction: empty arrays 
are returned instead of null if no empty restriction is produced.
18) Changed byte[][] into String[] in case of proxy restrictions (consistently)
19) Added  X500Principal getX500Principal(String rfcDn) to X500NameUtils

DEV NOTES:

- Why OpensslCertPAthValidator requires that each proxy (not PC issuer cert) 
has a digital signature bit set?

- Why two Validators? Proxy and Openssl? What about respective tests?

- !! HostnameChecker implements the RFC in a strict way. If there is a dNSAltName then CN is not used 
as RFC states. CN matching is used only if dNS altName is not present. 

- concatArrayArrays in IPAddressComparator is broken.
