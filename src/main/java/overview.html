This library was designed in the first place to support authentication and 
related operations of the components maintained by the EMI project.  

The EMI X.509 Common Authentication Library, Java edition provides support for:
<ul>
 <li> off-line certificate validation,
 <li> creation of SSL sockets (both server and client side),
 <li> handling certificate DNs, also in text format,
 <li> usage of proxy certificates.
</ul>
The library provides implementation of an easy to use and flexible validation 
logic using ready to be used trust material sources and fully supports 
proxy certificates commonly used in grid environment. The library 
is designed in such a way that it nicely integrates with the standard JSSE.
<p>
Usage examples:
<br><br>
Checking a certificate chain using OpenSSL style directory with trusted CA 
certificates: 
<pre>
X509Certificate[] toBeChecked = ...;
OpensslCertChainValidator v = new OpensslCertChainValidator("/my/certs", 
            CrlCheckingMode.REQUIRE, NamespaceCheckingMode.IGNORE, 10000);

ValidationResult result = v.validate(toBeChecked);
</pre>

Creating SSLServerSocket using Keystore with trusted CA certificates: 
<pre>
KeystoreCertChainValidator v = new KeystoreCertChainValidator("/my/truststore.jks",
			keystorePassword, CrlCheckingMode.REQUIRE, "JKS", null, 1000);

X509Credential c = new KeystoreCredential("/my/keystore.jks", ksPasswd, keyPasswd, 
			serverKeyAlias, "JKS");
SSLServerSocketFactory sslSsf = SocketFactoryCreator.getServerSocketFactory(c, v);
   
ServerSocket sslSS = sslSsf.createServerSocket();
</pre>
 
<p>
The {@link eu.emi.security.authn.x509.CertificateChecker} interface, its all 
implementations and {@link eu.emi.security.authn.x509.ValidationErrorListener} 
interface are supposed to be a low-level API and typically will not be used directly. 
However those classes are not hidden as sometimes it might be good to have an option 
to use them to influence the standard validation process.
